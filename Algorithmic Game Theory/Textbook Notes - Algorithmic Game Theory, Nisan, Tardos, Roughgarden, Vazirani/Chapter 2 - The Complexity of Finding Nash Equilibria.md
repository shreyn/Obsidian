## MAIN TAKEAWAY: Computing Nash equilibria is hard, so we need ways to approximate/learn instead. 

## 2.1 Introduction
**Nash's theorem says that every finite game has a mixed Nash equilibrium.** 
How do we find this Nash?
- Why do we care about the complexity of finding the Nash? If something is not easily computable, then its value as a prediction of behavior is lost.
