# Selection Pressure
- $\Rightarrow$ how strongly the EA favors better performing individuals (given a group of individuals, who gets to be a parent?)
	- high pressure = fast convergence, risk of local minima; low pressure = slow progress, higher diversity
	- Ex: Let population be:


| Individual | Fitness     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| A          | 0.1 (best)  |
| B          | 0.2         |
| C          | 0.5         |
| D          | 1.0         |
| E          | 2.0 (worst) |
